# Cycle93


## Introduction: 

Cycle93 will be a virtual community center for the graduates of the 93rd iteration of Per Scholas' Software Engineering RTT program. Users can post requests for help with coding related issues, offer classes on their expert topics, and share resources. Users will be able to react to all posts and resources with predefined tags, and the tags will provide the basis for sorting and search functionality.



## Technologies Used: 

-- MongoDB/Mongoose <br />
-- Express <br />
-- React <br />
-- Node <br />



## Getting Started: 

Link to the deployed app (DB connection not working yet) <br />
<a href="https://cycle93.onrender.com">https://cycle93.onrender.com</a> <br />



## Unsolved Problems: 


-- fix db connection on deployment site <br />
-- create a system for tags to make them 'interlinkable' <br />
-- fill with 'taggable' content <br />



## Future Enhancements: 

Identify future features and enhancements planned for the project. <br />



## Project Presentation

You will have 7 minutes to present and demonstrate the following: <br />
-- Introduce your project by paraphrasing its README. <br />
-- Click the link in the README to open the deployed app. <br />
-- Demonstrate authentication features by signing up a new user, logging out that user, then logging in with your preferred user.  <br />
-- Demonstrate your app's main features. <br />

Share/discuss the following code (not line-by-line): <br />
-- The main/central Mongoose model <br />
-- Your "favorite" Express controller method <br />
-- Your "favorite" React component <br />
-- The client-side routing <br />

Share the experience by answering the following: <br />
